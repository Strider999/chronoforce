# Summary #
XNA RPG game that mixes the styles of Final Fantasy with Chrono Trigger.  Along with the traditional time battles and combo attacks from Chrono Trigger, the game also implements a Time system, where certain traditional spells, like Cure and Revive, are now considered a Time based spell and certain events are time based.  This is currently a one man team, so progress will be slow.
